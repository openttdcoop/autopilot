Autopilot

autopilot is a Tcl script which uses Tcl's Expect package to interface with
OpenTTD's dedicated server console to provide network games with additional
features not normally available with the game alone. This is the operator's
manual for version 2.0 of autopilot.

Overview

autopilot is a modular script. It comes as a set of Tcl source files. Some of
these require that additional Tcl packages be installed in order to run.

-----

Base module

The base module consists of autopilot.tcl, autopilot-lib.tcl and a language
file. Alone, it provides the following features:

  • Periodic automatic server password changes
  • Implementation of max_clients, max_companies and max_spectators settings in
    openttd.cfg (not normally available in OpenTTD revision 6280 and earlier)
  • Implementation of net_frame_freq setting in openttd.cfg
  • Automatic pausing of the server when the number of connected clients is
    below a user-defined threshold
  • Greeting of players, by name, as they join the server (up to three chat
    lines)
  • Changes behaviour of exit console command to save the game to game.sav
    before closing the server
  • Changes behaviour of save console command to use a default of game.sav if
    no file is specified
  • adds version and license commands to console
  • adds an admin pager facility to the game

autopilot takes control of the server's dedicated console. Optionally, it can
allow pass-through commands so that the server's operator can use the console
as normal, although this comes at the price of slightly reduced responsiveness.

-----

IRC module

The IRC module consists of autopilot-irc.tcl, and requires that tcllib is
installed. When enabled, it provides the following additional features:

  • Bridging of in-game chat with IRC channel, allowing IRC users to converse
    with players, and vice-versa.
  • Provides channel and privmsg commands to query the players and companies on
    the server
  • Provides channel and privmsg commands to show server version and newgrf
    settings
  • Provides privmsg rcon commands, allowing IRC users with the rcon password
    to control the server
  • Provides channel and privmsg commands allowing IRC users to learn the
    current password
  • Supports CTCP VERSION and can identify to IRC services

-----

MySQL module

The MySQL module consists of autopilot-mysql.tcl, and requires that mysqltcl is
installed. When enabled, it provides the following additional features:

  • Storage of the current server password in the database, to allow database
    aware applications to reveal it
  • Logging of in-game chat, client joins, quits and name changes to a
    database, including logical separation of games and servers to allow for
    many servers to log to the same database

The module supports database table prefixing, to allow easy co-existence with
other database applications.

-----

Language

autopilot's messages can be easily translated to other languages by including
additional language files. Version 2.0 comes with one language file,
lang_english.tcl, which can be copied and modified to facilitate translation.
The server requires that openttd be in English (at present).

-----

Configuration

autopilot is configured through openttd.cfg. If a different configuration file
is to be used, it must be specified to autopilot through the OTTD_CONFIG
environment variable. Included with autopilot is the file
openttd_additional.cfg, which contains the additional sections required to
operate the script. autopilot will fail to run without this configuration.

-----

IRC

If you wish autopilot to have its IRC nickname identified with services on your
chosen network, it is necessary for the nickname to be registered in advance.

-----

MySQL

In order to use the MySQL module, the script must have access to a properly
configured MySQL server in which the tables can be found. Such configuration is
beyond the scope of this document, except to say that the file autopilot.sql
contains the necessary CREATE TABLE commands for a MySQL 5.0 server.

-----

openttd.cfg

Here follows a line by line description of all the new openttd.cfg options used
by autopilot. They are all specified in the form of option = value. Boolean
values can be yes, true or on to set a feature, and anything else to un-set it.

-----

network section

In the [network] section, the following commands are added:

max_companies
    Set to an integer (maximum of 8 is the default). Specify the maximum number
    of companies allowed in the game.
max_players
    Set to an integer (maximum of 10 is the default). Specify the maximum
    number of players allowed to connect to the game.
max_spectators
    Set to an integer (maximum of 10 is the default). Specify the maximum
    number of spectators allowed to connect to the game.

-----

autopilot section

    for Linux, openttd.exe for Windows, etc)
language
    String value. Selects the language file lang_language.tcl where language is
    the content of this setting.
responsiveness
    Integer value. Used when the console is enabled (see below). Amount of
    time, in seconds, between autopilot switching its attention between the
    console (for command entry) and the server. Lower numbers make the server
    more responsive to commands and events, higher numbers decrease CPU use
    slightly.

    Boolean value. Specifies whether to load the IRC module.
use_mysql
    Boolean value. Specifies whether to load the MySQL module.
use_console
    Boolean value. Specifies whether to enable pass-through commands to the
    user of the console. If turned off, the server ismuch more responsive, but
    control can only be taken through the server's rcon facility.
randomize_password
    Boolean value. Enables the periodic password change feature.
password_list
    String value. Filename of a text file containing a list of possible
    passwords to choose from. The format should be one password per line.
password_frequency
    Boolean value. Number of milliseconds between password changes. 300000 is 5
    minutes.
pause_level
    Integer value. autopilot will pause the game if this many clients, or less,
    are connected to the server.
irc_server
    String value, used only by the IRC module. The domain name or IP address of
    the IRC server.
irc_port

    String value, used only by the IRC module. The IRC channel to join after
    connecting. Must use one of # for global channels, and @ for local
    channels.
irc_bridge
    Boolean value, used only by the IRC module. Specifies whether autopilot
    will show the game chat in the IRC channel, and vice versa.
irc_explicit_say
    Boolean value, used only by the IRC module. If set, IRC users must use !say
    to communicate with game players.
irc_rcon
    Boolean value, used only by the IRC module. Enables use of the rcon command
    from IRC.

    Character value, used only by the IRC module. Specifies the character that precedes a command in the channel.
motd1
    String value. A string to be sent to game chat when a player joins the
    server. Uses variable substitution.
motd2
    as motd1
motd3
    as motd1
recount_frequency
    Integer value. Number of milliseconds between client recounts (300000 is 5
    minutes). Used to maintain an accurate count for the pause_level setting in
    the event that clients join or quit without messages (rare, but does
    happen).
mysql_server
    String value, used only by the MySQL module. The domain name or IP address
    of the MySQL server.
mysql_database
    String value, used only by the MySQL module. The name of the databse which

    server, which must be a key in the server table in the database.
smtp_server
    String value. SMTP relay server used for the admin pager command. leave
    empty to disable.

-----

responses section

The [responses] section is used for keyword = response style command
definitions. These responses are used solely by the IRC module to provide (and
override) commands in the channel and by private message. Variable
substitutions are supported in the responses.

-----

Variable substitutions

Variable substitution is a means of making responses more dynamic. They are
supported in the motd1, motd2 and motd3 settings, as well as in the [responses]
section. The variables are specified as all-capital keywords. Wherever one o
fthese keywords is found in these settings, the keyword is replaced with a
substituted string. The substitutions are as follows.

NAME
    Only used in motd1, motd2 and motd3. This is replaced with the name of the
    client that has joined the server.
COMPANIES
    Replaced with an integer, being the number of companies in the game the
    last time that autopilot counted them.
EMAIL
    Replaced with the email address specified in the emailsetting in the
    [autopilot] section.
LICENSE
    Replaced with the license string, as defined in the language file.
PASSWORD
    Replaced with the current server password.
PLAYERS
    Replaced with an integer, being the number of connected clients.
URL
    Replaced with the URL specified in the urlsetting in the [autopilot]
    section.
VERSION
    Replaced with the current autopilot version string
OTTD
    Replaced with the current OpenTTD revision or release number.

-----

Use

Once configured, starting autopilot is simply a matter of running the file
autopilot.tcl from a terminal. Optionally, the command line parameter load will
load the game in save/game.sav. An optional second parameter is the name of a
specific saved game to load:

./autopilot.tcl

This starts a new game according to what's defined in openttd.cfg

./autopilot.tcl load

This loads and continues save/game.sav

./autopilot.tcl load save/special.sav

This loads and continues save/special.sav

-----

Chat commands

From within the game chat, three commands are acted upon by autopilot.

!page admin

This command will attempt to send an email to the admin email address.

!version

This command will show the autopilot version to players.

show autopilot version

This command will show the autopilot version to players (and has been supported
since the very first version).

-----

MySQL module

Use of the MySQL server requires a little more preparation. The following steps
must be taken:

 1. The server must be named in the server table, and its key specified in
    openttd.cfg
 2. The game must have a name in the game table, and the server's key must be
    inserted in the server field as a foreign key
 3. A record must be inserted into the setup table specifying the setting of
    current_game, the server's key in th server field and the key of the game
    in the game table as a foreign key in the value field.

There is currently no tool to do this included with autopilot. Once this is
done, autopilot will automatically log the game's chat to the chatlog table (if
enabled) and will write the server password to the setup table whenever it has
changed. The password will be the value field in a record where setting is
password and server is the server's key, as specified in openttd.cfg.

-----

IRC module

The autopilot will use it's own playername as its IRC nickname. It will attempt
to join its channel. If kicked, it will not rejoin unless invited. If it is
invited (to anywhere, by anybody) it will take that as its cue to attempt to
join its own channel.

All commands are sent by private message or in the channel. If sent in the
channel, they are preceded with an exclamation mark (!).

If IRC bridging is enabled, players can converse with the IRC channel simply by
using the in-game chat. If irc_explicit_say is disabled, IRC users can converse
with players simply by talking in the IRC channel. If it is enabled, they must
use the !say command in the channel to be seen in the game:

!say Hi there.

This command must also be used, even if irc_explicit_say is disabled, if an IRC
user wishes what they said to be logged with the in-game chat by the MySQL
module.

If irc_enable_rcon is on, then any IRC user with the rcon password can execute
rcon commands on the OpenTTD server by sending a private message to the
autopilot:

/msg autopilot rcon password net_frame_freq 1

This command would set the OpenTTD variable net_frame_freq to 1 if autopilot's
rcon password was password. rcon cannot be used in the channel.

Other commands which can be used by default, either by private message or in
channel:

version
    shows the autopilot version
newgrf
    lists the newgrf lines you’d need in your openttd.cfg
companies
    lists the companies that are in the game
players
    lists the players and spectators that are in the game
url
    gives the #openttdcoop web site address
wiki
    gives the URL of the wiki
blog
    gives the URL of this blog
email
    gives the email address of an admin (er, mine, as it happens…)
revision
    shows the revision number of the openttd server
playercount
    shows you the number of players inthe game
companycount
    shows you the number of companies in the game

Most of these are defined in the [responses] section of openttd.cfg and can be
altered or removed by autopilot's operator. New commands can be added the same
way.

The newgrf command, if disabled, will still work by private message. This is by
design, and allows players to request the newgrf list from the server whilst
still allowing the option of not dumping huge amounts of text into the channel.

-----

Windows

Whilst autopilot works perfectly with ActiveTcl, it is unfortunate that its
Expect package is unable to take control over a Windows based openttd dedicated
server without modification of the latter. A modification tool is available in
this post on tt-forums.net which will convert the Windows openttd.exe to a
console application capable of being controlled.

-----

Support

Because autopilot is free software, it is provided without any warranty. That
said, the author (Brian Ronald, aka Brianetta) is normally happy to provide
help with autopilot to those who ask nicely.
