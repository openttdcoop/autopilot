1) About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    autopilot is a Tcl script which uses Tcl's Expect package to interface with
    OpenTTD's dedicated server console to provide network games with additional
    features not normally available with the game alone.

    ap+, based on the original autopilot project, adds more features and allows
    custom commands and callbacks to be put in place without requiring changes
    be made to the source code.



2) Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Tcl 8.4 (or above)
    Tcllib 1.11 (or above)
    Expect 5.44 (or above)

    For kill signal handling you will also need Tclx.

    ap+ is designed to run on unix like operating systems.
    Windows is NOT SUPPORTED
    


3) Runnin Autopilot
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most commonly ap+ is setup by placing the openttd binary and config file
    next to the autopilot.tcl file. Append the contents of the ap+ config file
    named openttd_additional.cfg at the end of openttd.cfg
        cat openttd_additional.cfg >> openttd.cfg

    Take your time and modify the newly added sections in openttd.cfg
    Note: if you want a IRC connection, ensure that the network.client_name
    is a valid nick name according to the irc network you want to join.
    i.e. spaces are usually not permitted (some other chars are not either).

    You can however also create your openttd.cfg next to autopilot.tcl and
    change the option autopilot.command to reflect the position of your
    openttd binary.

    Before you start autopilot.tcl for the first time, run openttd the same
    way it gets executed by autopilot:
        ./openttd -D -c openttd.cfg

    If all goes well and you are happy with the outcome, it is time to run
    autopilot.tcl
        ./autopilot.tcl

    Note: if you are connected to your server via ssh and want to ensure
    the game stays alive even when you disconnect your ssh connection,
    we suggest you look into 'screen'.
    screen itself is however not covered by this readme.



4) Reporting Bugs

5) Known Issues
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Segmentation Fault
        Ubuntu 10.04 currently has a bug in it's tcl8.4 and expect packages.
        Due to this, autopilot will die with a segfault when requireing
        the expect package.

        possible fixes:
            a) use tcl8.5
            b) ActiveTcl8.4 from ActiveState.

        Bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcl8.4/+bug/581607


    Supybot + Alias Module
        This combination imposes a security risk, as without additional
        ACL rules in Supybot (or possibly any other supybot).

        It can allow a normal irc user to execute any command directly on
        OpenTTD's console.
